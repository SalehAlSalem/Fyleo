# Resource-Sharing

Welcome to the College Resource Sharing Website! This platform is designed to facilitate the sharing of educational resources among college students. Whether you need lecture notes, study guides, practice exams, or any other material, this website is here to help you.

## Overview

Every year we require notes and previous year questions to study for our exams and for this we contact many people and sometimes we don't get the resources at the right time.
<br>
So to cope up with that we are building this resource sharing webiste to help the students so that they get the right resources at the right time.
